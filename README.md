## OSC Control for Logig-Pro  with Chataigne
In Chataigne you will find this module under "Software" and "Community Modules" with the name of ''LogicPro [iPad] (TouchOSC)'' ! Please don't change the ''[iPad] (TouchOSC)''-part of the name as the module will than stop working !!   

Make sure to use a network other than 127.0.0.xx as with this particular local network the module does not connect to Logic-Pro! All other local networks will be fine ! Just set the right IP-Address for Remote-Output. Than a Touch-OSC-Controller named LogigPro should be automatically inserted in the controller-configuration when launching Chataigne and Logic-Pro.  

This module uses the Touch-OSC handling to connect to Logic-Pro; and so all the known OSC commands from its  Templater (LogicPad) will work fine and instantly !!  
To see all these possible OSC-Messages : In Logic Pro just go to the LogicPro -> MainMenu -> ControlSurfaces -> Assigning Controllers -> Pages (in the left column) .... and you'll see all the OSC-Commands already implemented ! And if you want, you can create also your own Custom Messages in the osc-message-paths section (first define new : Zone, Mode and Commande, etc)

Have Fun....
